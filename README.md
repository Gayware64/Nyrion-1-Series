# Nyrion-1-Series

**Nyrion 1 Continued â€” Updates & Features for Legacy Users**
This repository is dedicated to users who prefer to stay on Nyrion 1 rather than upgrading to Nyrion 2, but still want ongoing updates, bug fixes, and new features.

Why This Repo?
With the official focus shifting to Nyrion 2, many users who love Nyrion 1 found themselves without new improvements or support. This project aims to keep Nyrion 1 alive and thriving by:

- Providing regular updates and bug fixes

- Introducing new features tailored for the Nyrion 1 experience

- Maintaining compatibility with existing setups and workflows

- Listening to the community of legacy users and incorporating their feedback

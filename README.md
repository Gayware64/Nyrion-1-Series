A Friendly Terminal for Beginners – CLI Power, GUI Comfort
by GayWare64

Nyrion Series 1 is a hybrid Graphical + Command-Line Terminal designed for people who want to learn the terminal but find it confusing or intimidating.
It blends the freedom of CLI with the accessibility of a GUI, making the learning curve smoother without removing the fun of real commands.

This is also perfect for people who don't like the look of Nyrion 2.0 and prefer the look of 1.4/1.5.
